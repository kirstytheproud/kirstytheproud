### I'm a full-stack software developer and creative coder.
Initially I studied at Central Saint Martins to become a product designer, but I realised even though I love and appreciate design, I was much more interested in the inner-workings of the powerful software that designers always use. I love exploring the intersection of creativity, design and technology!
